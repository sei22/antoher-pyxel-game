# Toxic Survival - Pyxel Game

## Description
**Toxic Survival** is a 2D game developed with **[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel?tab=readme-ov-file)** where the player navigates a hazardous environment. The player is represented by a square and must survive as long as possible in a toxic world.

This game was created in a single day in 2022 as part of a student project during my final year of high school, in a team of three.

## Gameplay
- **Player:** Represented as a square.
- **Environment:** Toxic, decreasing the player’s life over time.
- **Life Bar:** Displayed at the top-left corner, representing the player’s remaining health.
- **Movement:** Use the **W, A, S, D** keys to move the player around.
- **Liana Mechanic:** Deploy a liana to swing across obstacles or reach higher areas by clicking on a wall or obstacle.
- **Oxygen Mask:** Collect oxygen masks along the way to refill your life bar and extend survival.

## Controls
- **Move:** `W` (up), `A` (left), `S` (down), `D` (right)  
- **Deploy Liana:** Click on a wall or obstacle  
- **Collect Items:** Move over oxygen masks to collect them

## Objective
Survive as long as possible in the toxic environment and reach the goal while navigating obstacles, using lianas strategically, and replenishing life with oxygen masks.

## Future Improvements

- Add more obstacles and hazards
- Introduce power-ups and special items
- Implement levels with increasing difficulty
